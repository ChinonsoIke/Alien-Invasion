# Alien-Invasion
Alien Invasion game built using Python and Pygame library.
I'm working on my Python superpowers, so I created this game by following the book, "Python Crash Course- A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming", by Eric Matthes.

# Introduction
In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
